 * HamerlyKmeans implements Hamerly's k-means algorithm that uses one lower
 * bound per point.
 *
 * This adds to the Hamerly's algorith tighter lower bound update and
 * iteration over neighbours. This iteration over neighbors is implemented
 * also for the first iteration, which means some additional modifications
 * to the runThread method.
